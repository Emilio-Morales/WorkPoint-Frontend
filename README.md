- **SQL Express**: Set up and configure SQL Express.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emilio-Morales/dotnet-frontend.git
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment variables**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory.  
   - Add the following line to set the backend URL:  
   ```bash
   NEXT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
   
4. **Start the development servers**  

   - Start the frontend development server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Access the application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Backend Setup

The backend for this project is hosted in a separate [repository](https://github.com/Emilio-Morales/WorkPoint-Backend.git). Follow the steps below to set up the backend:

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emilio-Morales/WorkPoint-Backend.git
   cd workpoint-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Create an `appsettings.json` file:  
   If the file is not included in the repository, create it in the root directory of the backend project. Use the following structure as an example, updating the connection string with your SQL Express instance details:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     },
     "Logging": {
       "LogLevel": {
         "Default": "Information",
         "Microsoft": "Warning",
         "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
       }
     },
     "AllowedHosts": "*"
   }
   ```

4. Update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to match your local SQL Express instance.

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Update the database connection string in the backend configuration file.

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
